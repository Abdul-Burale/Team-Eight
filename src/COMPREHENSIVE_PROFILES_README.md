## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Each profile is a self-contained component
function LandlordProfile({ onNavigate }) {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('dashboard');
  // ... state management
  
  return (
    <Tabs value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab}>
      <TabsList>...</TabsList>
      <TabsContent value="dashboard">...</TabsContent>
      <TabsContent value="listings">...</TabsContent>
      // ... more tabs
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

### State Management

      └── default → General settings
```

### Data Flow

  const response = await fetch('/api/properties', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)
