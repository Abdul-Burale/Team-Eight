## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure

```
/components/profiles/
├── LandlordProfile.tsx
├── TenantProfile.tsx
└── BuyerProfile.tsx

/components/
└── UserProfile.tsx (Router)
```

### Routing Logic

The `UserProfile.tsx` component acts as a router that:
1. Checks the authenticated user's type
2. Routes to the appropriate profile component
3. Passes navigation function for internal routing
4. Falls back to general settings if no specific type

### State Management

Each profile uses React hooks for:
- Tab navigation state
- Dialog visibility
- Form data
- Selected items
- Filters and sorting

### Data Flow

```
App.tsx 
  └── UserProfile.tsx (Router)
      ├── LandlordProfile.tsx
      ├── TenantProfile.tsx
      └── BuyerProfile.tsx
```

### Navigation

All profiles receive `onNavigate` function to:
- Navigate to search results
- View property details
- Access market intelligence
- Navigate to other sections

---
